# Klrfl's Neovim Config

My personal Nvim config I built myself. It's a mix of my own code and YouTube tutorial code, specifically [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev/playlists), [ThePrimeAgen](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE), and [devaslife](https://youtu.be/ajmK0ZNcM4Q). I use this config for my web dev needs.

After using my config for a while, I decided to change my plugin manager from Packer to Lazy.nvim. All the plugins are now in `lua/plugins`.

## Dependecies/ things you have to install

- Nerd Fonts. I use [JetBrains Mono](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (not a requirement, but icons will not work if you don't have nerd fonts.)
- Git to clone this config
- GCC
- Node + NPM to install the LSPs
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
