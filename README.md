# Klrfl's Neovim Config 
My personal Nvim config I built myself. It's a mix of my own code and YouTube tutorial code, specifically [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev/playlists), [ThePrimeAgen](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE), and [devaslife](https://youtu.be/ajmK0ZNcM4Q). I use this config for my web dev needs.

I haven't figured out support for Astro though, the only thing missing is formatting and syntax highlighting on the frontmatter. Please make a PR if you can help me 🙏🙏

## Dependecies/ things you have to install
- Nerd Fonts (I use [JetBrains Mono](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads))
