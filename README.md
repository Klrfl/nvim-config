# nvim-config
My personal Nvim config I built myself. It's a mix of my own code and YouTube tutorial code. I use this config for my web dev needs.

I haven't figured out support for Astro though, the only thing missing is formatting and syntax highlighting on the frontmatter. Please make a PR if you can help me 🙏🙏

## Dependecies/ things you have to install
